Current and future market trends force entities to be increasingly competitive. Every entity that wishes to compete in the current market must consider the information and accessibility of it; as one of the most important assets. For this reason, it is necessary for the entity to have the appropriate Information Systems to quickly and efficiently supply information with additional value in a reservation and service system within the reach of its users.
